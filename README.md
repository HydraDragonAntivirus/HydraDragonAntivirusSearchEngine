# HydraDragonAntivirusSearchEngine
- Trying to find zero day malicious IP addresses from the web? Use this search engine. It's not a full antivirus product, it only uses database to extract related unknown ip addresses, no scanning of ip address content by all HydraDragonAntivirus engines etc.
- This malicious unknown ipv4/ipv6 finder feed is designed for Comodo Antivirus community. Since Comodo blocks malware containment and blocks malicious ip via firewall or website filtering it does a good job but on unknown c2 servers it sometimes misses and your data is stolen into darkweb. My goal is to fix this.
- If you detect malware with your original IP, remove it from the logs and create an abuseipdb account to avoid being reported.
- Please only submit new IP addresses, and not just to Comodo, but also to AbuseIPDB.
- Don't forget to check your list before you use it.
- You can use the examples folder JSON file to load settings.
